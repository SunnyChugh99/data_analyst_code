PACKAGES 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Python, a package is a collection of modules organized in directories. A package allows you to logically organize your code into 
manageable components and reuse code effectively.

Modules are individual Python files containing code (functions, classes, etc.).
Packages are directories that contain a special __init__.py file, indicating that the directory is a Python package.



NUMPY ==> A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.


PANDAS ==> A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like DataFrame (2D table-like data structure) and Series (1D data structure) to handle structured data.


matplotlib ==> A popular data visualization library in Python. It is highly customizable and allows you to create plots, charts, and graphs.


seaborn ==> A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative visualizations.




pd.read_csv()

read_csv(): This is a function from the pandas library that reads a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file and returns a DataFrame object. It is one of the most commonly used methods to load data into Python from CSV files.


data.iloc[0]

Using .iloc[]
iloc[] is used for integer-location based indexing, where you specify the row index and column index.
